          EQ and IQ
        </span>
        <h3>This is a quick post on my research into Emotional Intelligence(EQ) and Intelligence Quotient (IQ)</h3>
        <p>We will cover three main topics in this post</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What is Emotional Intelligence?</li>
          <li>How is EQ different to IQ?</li>
          <li>Why is EQ important?</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>1. </b> Mental health America defines Emotional Intelligence as “the ability to manage both your own emotions and understand the emotions of people around you”. In other words, it is a “measure (no score though)” for your ability to perceive others emotions 
          and understand their perspective as well as your ability to use emotions to navigate social situations.
        </p>
        <p><b>2. </b>EQ is different from IQ in that IQ is a scoring system to measure one’s processing, 
          memory and critical thinking abilities. While EQ is a rough measure of emotional competency. 
          It involves looking at emotions to identify a social situation. 
          It affects empathy, relationships, self awareness, self control and motivation. 
          There are multiple types of EQ. There is a set ‘score’ for IQ that you can find from a standardised test while EQ is a bit harder to measure, the score is not from a test so to speak, 
          but rather from experiencing social situations.
        </p>
        <p><b>3. </b>I am going to answer this question from the perspective of the workplace, 
          but I truly believe EQ is deeply important in all aspects of life. 
          It is important for people in charge to view things objectively by keeping a level head and taking a step back when confrontations or tensions arise in a team. Understanding and empathy are deeply important for conflict solving, whether it be in a tension scenario or in a non-verbal situation. Recognising there may be problems without someone speaking and at least communicating about it makes a huge difference in teamwork.
