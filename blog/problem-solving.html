              This is a post of some stories about some problems I have been
              stuck on the last week, and how I solved them.
            </p>
            <p>
              As well as a breakdown of some problem-solving techniques and how
              comfortable I am using them.

            <h1>A Story about a Time I was Blocked on A Simple Problem</h1>
            <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
            <p>
              This week I had a lot of trouble with a simple problem. The
              problem was with a function which would take a set of test scores
              and assign them to a student.
            </p>
            <p>
              Basically I was trying to add an object property to an already
              existing object property.<br />
              But the main issue I had was figuring out a way to find the
              correct object to add the test scores to.
            </p>
            <h2>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
            <p>
              The problem-solving technique I used was a lot, a lot, a lot of
              googling. Seriously every google search even remotely close to
              this problem is purple now.
            </p>
            <img class="image" src="/images/googleSearchPic.png" />
            <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
            <p>
              Quite frustrated to be honest. I thought “Surely this can’t be
              that complicated, it’s only question 3 on the 4th kata!” <br />but
              eventually I came across the .hasOwnProperty() method in an MDN
              web doc.
            </p>
            <p>
              This quickly solved my issue alongside a little help from Dave
              about dot versus bracket notation.
            </p>
            <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
            <p>
              I learned that I might need to work on breaking questions down and
              get better at explaining my problems. <br />I found it quite
              difficult to explain what I was actually struggling with here at
              the start, <br />and I think I luckily stumbled upon the
              .hasOwnProperty() method rather than any kind of skilled googling.
              Something to work on in the future!
            </p>
            <h1>A Story about a Time I elegantly Solved a Problem</h1>
            <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
            <p>
              The problem I elegantly solved this week was the stretch question
              in the gradebook kata. <br />This kata involved creating a new
              gradebook from scratch in one function. <br />An empty object, an
              array of student names and an array of test scores were passed
              into a function as arguments.
            </p>
            <img src="/images/gradebook-3-code.png" class="blogImage" />
            <h2>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</h2>
            <p>
              The problem-solving technique I used was trying something out.
              <br />I did a few attempts at completing the function before I
              realised I was basically doing the same as question 3. <br />So I
              copy-pasted my code from question 3 into the new enterScores
              function and it worked! .forEach() is a powerful method
            </p>
            <img src="/images/gradebook-stretch-code.png" class="blogImage" />
            <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
            <p>
              To be honest I was a bit chuffed when I copy pasted the code into
              the function and it worked. <br />Throughout the process, I think
              I was overthinking the problem at first but once I broke what the
              function was actually asking to do, <br />I realised I had
              basically solved it already.
            </p>
            <h2>What did you learn?</h2>
            <p>
              I learned that sometimes in programming, the best answer is a
              simple one. <br />Instead of overcomplicating everything with for
              loops and if else if ladders, you can use pre built-in methods and
              such to complete logic puzzles.

            <h2>Psuedocode</h2>
            <p>
              I think I am using pseudocode fairly well already, but I need to
              get better at breaking down problems before I attempt them.

            <h2>Trying Something</h2>
            <p>
              Fairly comfortable with this technique, just need to fully break
              down problems before I attempt something.
            </p>

            <h2>Rubber Ducky Method</h2>
            <p>
              I like this technique, it helps me break down problems into
              smaller steps. <br />But I think I might need to actually buy a
              rubber ducky because it is a bit embarrassing talking to my less
              tech savvy friends about tech stuff.
            </p>

            <h2>Reading Error Messages</h2>
            <p>
              I really like trying to solve stuff backwards like this.
              <br />Seeing what is being rejected by tests and the code editor
              helps me see what isn’t making sense to the computer/browser.
            </p>

            <h2>Console.logging</h2>
            <p>
              Console logging is like 95% of what I do dude. <br />I'm sure
              whoever is marking my work is going to get annoyed at how many
              console.logs are in my functions (sorry!) <br />Really nice to see
              what is actually happening to variables etc.
            </p>
            <h3>9/10</h3>
            <h2>Googling</h2>
            <p>
              I know that Googling is such an important tool in the day to day
              life of a programmer. <br />I feel very comfortable using it (as
              long as I actually know what the problem is asking of me)
            </p>
            <h3>10/10</h3>
            <h2>Asking your peers for help</h2>
            <p>
              I think I will be better at this along with asking my coaches for
              help in the bootcamp. <br />I still feel a bit uncomfortable
              asking questions in the Discord, but I am getting better!

            <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
            <p>
              I’ve gone back to last week's JS Cafe problem and attempted some
              stretch questions on the day of writing this blog. <br />It felt
              like my reflections from last week have helped this week’s kata
              problems immensely.
            </p>
            <h3>9/10</h3>
            <h1>A Reflection on a time I was Reluctant to ask for Help</h1>
            <p>
              I was reluctant to ask for help with the getScore function in the
              gradebook kata. I think I was reluctant because I thought I could
              do it myself, and I can be a bit stubborn like that sometimes. But
              eventually I realised it would be better to just ask a question I
              thought was silly, rather than sitting for a few hours to complete
              the question by brute forcing it. Next time I try to break the
              question down into simpler terms and ask questions more often.
