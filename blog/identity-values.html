        <h2 class="paragraphTitle">Short Post about My Identity Values</h2>
        <p>This is a quick blog post about my own personal values.</p>
        <p>
          1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.
          Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
          decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't want to share specifics about this, but basically a co worker
          and friend had a panic attack on an extremely busy day at work. I had
          a choice between helping them, making sure they were alright and
          continuing to work. I chose to help them first and then come back to
          work. I believe this was the right choice as no matter what I believe
          in people being comfortable and happy in a workspace/productive
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lot of my values come from working in amazing and (one) award
          winning kitchens as well as my friends growing up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing multiple more than 10 hour shifts means you have to know and
          trust your team through and through so I would say I have a good
          background working with groups to create amazing things.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
          learning journey.
        </p>
        <p>I would say my main strengths are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Punctual</li>
          <li>Humourous</li>
          <li>Friendly</li>
          <li>Easily-approachable</li>
          <li>Loyal</li>
          <li>Fast to pick up new skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I believe these strengths will support my learning journey through my
          willingness to work with others and openness to communication. I may
          not have the best technical skills but I believe my approach and
          experience with working in teams will help overcome that. I am really
          eager to meet my cohort and facilitators.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
          development. How might these affect your learning journey?
        </p>
        <p>
          I will say I have a bit of a phobia of sharing my work with large
          groups, so I will need to work on improving that during the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also think my initial strength with programming is not the best, but
          that's what I am here for and am aiming to improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
          others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
          tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
          what other strategies you would try now and why.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drunk coworker in a working kitchen. Only me and them were at work at
          the time. Guy was basically only capable of cooking one or two things.
          Busy service. Strategies - Take command and run the pass, while
          continuing work on my own section. Give instructions to this coworker.
          Reprimand after service, not during. Kept cool and level headed during
          service. Decently effective. Kept service running smoothly. Reflect on
          other strategies - would have liked to reprimand during service, but
          had to work under those circumstances (too busy not to). Might have
          called in another coworker if possible, was not possible at the time
          though as it was a 3 man team and other coworker was having a day off
          after working 10 days in a row.
