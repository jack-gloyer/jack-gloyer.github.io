          <h3><a id="neuro"></a>Neuroplasticity Research</h3>
          <h4>
            Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
            people.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The principles of neuroplasticity benefit people by aiding them in
            learning new skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, right now I am trying to utilise neuroplasticity while
            learning to code by making sure I practice my coding abilities for
            at least 2 hours everyday (I expect this to increase as the course
            goes on) even when I am doing these cultural research blogs.
            <br />This should significantly help my learning journey by
            maintaining skills and learning new skills.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
            for your benefit.
          </h4>
          <p>
            I will engage with the principles of neuroplasticity by coding for
            at least 2 hours per day during foundations. I expect this to
            increase in bootcamp. <br />I will also take care of my body, going
            for at least a 15 minute walk everyday and working out when I
            can.<br />
            I am also trying to maintain a good sleep schedule throughout the
            course in order to properly rest my body.
          </p>
          <h4>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
          <p>
            I would recommend to you to follow a similar type of daily
            lifestyle. I find it greatly helps me learn new abilities. <br />Try
            your best to look after your body and mind even when life gets busy
            and/or stressful.

          <h3><a id="growthMind"></a>Growth Mindset Research</h3>
          <h4>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h4>
          <p>
            Growth mindset is a different way of viewing obstacles and
            decisions. It is knowing that you can improve at anything with work.
            It is relevant because in order to improve we need to reflect and
            acknowledge failures, and find reasons to keep growing the mind
            (growth mindset).
          </p>
          <h4>
            In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
          </h4>
          <p>
            I found it surprising that I might’ve been in a ‘fixed’ mindset in
            some aspects when it came to my own learning. A fixed mindset is
            basically the opposite to the growth mindset. <br />Thinking that
            all growth is a static, non-malleable thing and that you are either
            good at something or you are bad at something. I am going to change
            my mindset to knowing that I can improve at something, even if I am
            not great at it straight away.
          </p>
          <h4>
            How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
          </h4>
          <p>
            I will integrate a growth mindset by reflecting on things that go
            wrong and trying to improve those things for next time. This is a
            fairly large shift in my mindset so I may need some time to work on
            this, but I can change it.
          </p>

            <a id="blend"></a>How I will blend this research with my Learning
            Plan
          </h3>
          <p>
            For starters I will implement a growth mindset into every piece of
            new knowledge. I believe this will greatly improve the speed at
            which I gain new skills, simply by not being too hard on myself in
            my education and knowing that I can make mistakes. <br />Mistakes
            are how I will improve. I will continue to practice my
            neuroplastistic (i just made this word up, but you know what I mean)
            tendencies.
