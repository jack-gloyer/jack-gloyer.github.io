            <h2>Foundations: </h2>
            <p>In the long run, I plan to use the skills I gain from DevAcademy to start a career in web development. It is mostly about a career change for me, trying something new. 
            </p>
            <p>During boot camp I believe I will use my strengths I‚Äôve gained working long hours in kitchens in teams to make it through. I‚Äôve found an ability to take a step back, take a break and come back to a problem in foundations. Before I would just try to dive headfirst into problems until they fixed themselves. Also I have begun planning before I do, mostly using pseudocode. I think these skills will help me in boot camp because it sounds like there is a lot of teamwork there. 
            </p>
            <p>My biggest non-technical challenge will probably be my commute to the campus. I think traveling from Waiheke to the New Market campus every day will be a big drain on my energy levels, but I keep telling myself it really is only 9-ish weeks (not including careers weeks here) so I can do it. I also believe speaking in front of big groups is a bit of a weakness, but it is something that I have improved on a lot in recent years.</p>
            <p>I would like to improve my willingness to ask for help, my self-awareness and reflection skills. I think I will need to continue to get better at explaining problems as well. I often find it hard to put problems from my brain into words or paper.
            </p>
            <p>From the bootcamp team, I expect them to be respectful and supportive of me and my peers‚Äô learning. I know bootcamp is going to be tough and I expect the team to help when and where they can. I also expect them to be fun, and hope to make a few friends during boot camp.</p>
            <p>For myself - I will commit to this boot camp as much as possible. I truly want to give it my best shot and succeed here. I want to take feedback constructively and I want to help others when needed. I plan to stick to the recommended 60(was it 60 or 80? Either way) hrs a week. I expect to make friends and maybe future colleagues here. I plan to work productively in teams by getting to know the members of the teams well, and learning from them.</p>
            <br></br>
            <h2>Week 7 Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>My previous experience with working in teams has helped during bootcamp.</p>
            <p>I think that, while I have developed my ability to step back and break down problems has improved during bootcamp, there has been a few days when the pressure has gotten to me and I forgot to ask for help.</p>
            <p>The long commute has not helped my energy levels during bootcamp, but I am used to it now. While I get tired, I know that we are almost at the end now and I can manage to do this long commute.</p>
            <p>Public speaking, I think I have improved on drastically during bootcamp. I almost look forward to presenting projects and ideas now.</p>
            <p>I think just in the last week or so my ability to know when I am stuck and need help has significantly improved. But I think my explanations of problems could still use some work.</p>
            <p>The facilitators have been amazing! Sooo much respect for everyone and they are so so patient and kind while explaining technical problems.</p>
            <p>I think that I am committing as much time as I can to bootcamp. While I don't think I am hitting 60 hrs every week, I am doing as much as I can considering my commute.</p>
            <p>Meeting my peers at bootcamp - everyone is so cool and chill, but so smart! Everyone is comfortable and close with everyone else as we are a small cohort, but I really enjoy that.</p>

          <div class = "paragraphTitle"><h2>A Quick Post about my Learning Plan with DevAcademy</h2></div>
          <p>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
          <p>My long term goal is to start a new career in web development. 
            After working for about 5(?) years without a specific career plan I‚Äôve decided to study at DevAcademy to accomplish this goal.</p>
          <p>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
          <p>It has been a while since I was last in a tertiary learning environment, so I will have to see what has changed since last time. But from my working experience I felt like I was able to pick up new things quickly. I was also able to do long hours while learning in a kitchen environment. My main limitation is probably my ability to describe problems in an effective manner.
          </p>
          <p>3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?	</p>
          <p>I would like to see my ability to ask for help and explain my problems properly improve while at DevAcademy. I also would like to see my communication skills improve, ie. updating people on what I am working on and where I am in said activity.</p>
          <p>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            <ul>
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
            <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
          </ul>
            </p>
          <p>In order to manage the workload at DevAcademy I will communicate effectively and efficiently with other learners about their work and how they are going. I will also ask questions after doing my own research/study in the help-desk and other such forum type spaces when I need help. 
              I will also try my absolute best to stick to and exceed the weekly times during foundations and bootcamp. 
              When things are starting to get to me I will hopefully have a support structure built up within the course to help me. I will also make use of my own personal support group (friends, family etc) to overcome and push past my struggles in the course.</p>
          <p>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
          <p>I will seek help mainly from the DevAcademy discord after doing my own troubleshooting for technical problems. I also have friends in the industry already who have said I can ask for help from them when needed. For personal problems I will likely rely on support from either friends who have done the course before or friends in the industry. I will seek help in a timely manner, but only after doing my own attempts to fix/help the problem.</p>
          <p>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
          <p>From the facilitation team I expect them to do their best to help everyone equally. I expect them to answer mine and my fellow students‚Äô questions in a timely manner to the best of their abilities. I also expect them to be max chillers.üòé</p>
          <p>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</p>
          <p>I have no major scheduling block-outs that I am aware of as of writing 
            this learning plan. The only thing I would consider a block-out would be that I live over on Waiheke Island and as such rely on ferries to get to campus when bootcamp starts. It might happen that a ferry gets canceled in the morning and I may be late/delayed getting to campus. But hopefully not!
