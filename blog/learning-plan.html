          <h2 class = "paragraphTitle">A Quick Post about my Learning Plan with DevAcademy</h2>
          <p>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</p>
          <p>My long term goal is to start a new career in web development. 
            After working for about 5(?) years without a specific career plan I‚Äôve decided to study at DevAcademy to accomplish this goal.</p>
          <p>2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</p>
          <p>It has been a while since I was last in a tertiary learning environment, so I will have to see what has changed since last time. But from my working experience I felt like I was able to pick up new things quickly. I was also able to do long hours while learning in a kitchen environment. My main limitation is probably my ability to describe problems in an effective manner.
          </p>
          <p>3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?	</p>
          <p>I would like to see my ability to ask for help and explain my problems properly improve while at DevAcademy. I also would like to see my communication skills improve, ie. updating people on what I am working on and where I am in said activity.</p>
          <p>4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
            <ul>
              <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
            <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
          </ul>
            </p>
          <p>In order to manage the workload at DevAcademy I will communicate effectively and efficiently with other learners about their work and how they are going. I will also ask questions after doing my own research/study in the help-desk and other such forum type spaces when I need help. 
              I will also try my absolute best to stick to and exceed the weekly times during foundations and bootcamp. 
              When things are starting to get to me I will hopefully have a support structure built up within the course to help me. I will also make use of my own personal support group (friends, family etc) to overcome and push past my struggles in the course.</p>
          <p>5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
          <p>I will seek help mainly from the DevAcademy discord after doing my own troubleshooting for technical problems. I also have friends in the industry already who have said I can ask for help from them when needed. For personal problems I will likely rely on support from either friends who have done the course before or friends in the industry. I will seek help in a timely manner, but only after doing my own attempts to fix/help the problem.</p>
          <p>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</p>
          <p>From the facilitation team I expect them to do their best to help everyone equally. I expect them to answer mine and my fellow students‚Äô questions in a timely manner to the best of their abilities. I also expect them to be max chillers.üòé</p>
          <p>7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</p>
          <p>I have no major scheduling block-outs that I am aware of as of writing 
            this learning plan. The only thing I would consider a block-out would be that I live over on Waiheke Island and as such rely on ferries to get to campus when bootcamp starts. It might happen that a ferry gets canceled in the morning and I may be late/delayed getting to campus. But hopefully not!
