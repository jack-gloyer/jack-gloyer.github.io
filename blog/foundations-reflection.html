          <h2>Answering Some Questions about Human Skills and Foundations</h2>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>
              What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
              ego due to the Human Skills learning?
            </h2>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I learned that I get a lot out of listening and looping, it really
            helps me to just talk about what I am doing and struggling with with
            another person
          </li>
          <li>I’ve learned to take constructive criticism better</li>
          <li>
            My mindset has entered a ‘when can i learn this’ rather than a ‘im
            not smart enough for this’ mindset.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h2>
              What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
              learning and programming?
            </h2>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of these are important to programming.</p>
        <p>
          Values are something to learn from other people (not just in your
          programming team, but in life in general) as well as upholding and
          being proud of your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy is very, very important while working in a team as you have to
          take time to understand and care about others while working on
          creative projects together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise people may feel uncomfortable and/or unmotivated and that
          may take a toll on their work. Self-awareness is knowing when to ask
          for help and what to ask for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing something is going wrong(or right) for you means that you can
          focus on changing or maintaining that thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being comfortable in a learning or programming environment means you
          can learn or work productively and safely.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <h2>
            <li>
              What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
            </li>
          </h2>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Shifting my own mindset was challenging. I did a lot of retrospective
          thinking to understand my own mindset wasn’t helping me learn and had
          to change it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also getting into a habit of practicing mindfulness by doing daily
          meditations was its own challenge.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <h2>
            <li>
              Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
              time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development
              Bootcamp course?
            </li>
          </h2>
        </ul>
        <p>
          DevAcademy,in my opinion, spends time focusing on human skills to
          prepare its students for working in the real world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is that these human skills are getting you ready to work
          productively in a team and know your own limitations and/or boundaries
          when working in a productive environment/in creative projects.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <h2>
            <li>
              Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel
              like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
              practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
            </li>
          </h2>
        </ul>
        <p>No. Human skills does not feel like a waste of time.</p>
        <p>
          DevAcademy is trying to get you a job after you graduate and, excuse
          my French, no one wants to work with a dick.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human Skills help you adjust to working in a team and working with a
          bad teammate isn’t a good time.
